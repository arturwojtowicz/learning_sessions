# We have list of 100 numbers - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 97, 98, 99, 100]
# If the number is divisible by 3 then print Fizz
# If the number is divisible by 5 then print Buzz
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
# Otherwise just print the number
# Checking is value divisible in python, You can use modulo f.e. check if value is divisible by 2 ->  x % 2 == 0
